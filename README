Simple script to tunnel through a server using ssh. I use this to tunnel to a University machine from which I can access some websites.

1. Run the script with your address as an argument:
	./ssh.sh user@my.domain.name
2. Follow the instructions below to get firefox to go through the right port

	Tools > Options

	OR

	Edit > Preferences

	THEN

	Advanced > Network > Settings

	SOCKS Host: localhost
	Port: 55555 (you can change this port in the file if you want)

	The version shouldn't matter, I don't think.

	This will now send all your browser traffic through port 55555 which will get sent to your ssh destination and then forwarded to the website you are trying to access
