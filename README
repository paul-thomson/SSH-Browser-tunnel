Simple script to tunnel through a server using ssh. I use this to tunnel to a University machine from which I can access some websites.

To get this to work on firefox you will need to do the following:

Tools > Options

OR

Edit > Preferences

THEN

Advanced > Network > Settings

SOCKS Host: localhost
Port: 55555 (you can change this port in the file if you want)

The version shouldn't matter, I don't think.

This will now send all your browser traffic through port 55555 which will get forward from you ssh destination to whatever websites you are accessing.
